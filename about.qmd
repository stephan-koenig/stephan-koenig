## Hi, there! Coffee?

I am an evolutionary biologist by training and a self-taught data scientist and previously worked as a PostDoc Teaching and Learning Fellow in the Microbiology and Immunology Department at the University of British Columbia (UBC), coordinating the [EDUCE initiative](https://educe-ubc.github.io). As a [Skylight](https://skylight.science.ubc.ca) Science Education Specialist in the Computer Science Department at UBC, I think about how modern computational tools can enhance teaching and learning. I often fantasize about unshackling files from directories and love the colour orange, pour-over coffee & Markdown.

### Philosophy

Learning shapes our beliefs, and our beliefs shape the world.

The ability to learn and acquire new skills is one of the defining characteristics of humans.

I live, work and learn on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded, traditional, ancestral [xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) Territory](https://www.musqueam.bc.ca/).
