<!-- This is a subheadline -->
I am an evolutionary biologist by training and a self-taught data scientist and previously worked as a PostDoc Teaching and Learning Fellow in the Microbiology and Immunology Department at the University of British Columbia (UBC), coordinating the [EDUCE initiative](https://educe-ubc.github.io). As a [Skylight](https://skylight.science.ubc.ca) Science Education Specialist in the Computer Science Department at UBC, I think about how modern computational tools can enhance teaching and learning. I often fantasize about unshackling files from directories and love the colour orange, pour-over coffee & Markdown.
